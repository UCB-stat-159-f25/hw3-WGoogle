The project is about LIGO data and being able to use these highly sensitive measurements for space stuff. The repo is mainly for being able to reproduce the research done in this field and show it in a clean way. 

This repo is founded on a MyST website. As requested, I am putting link here because I do not have permissions to edit the About Section on Github.
